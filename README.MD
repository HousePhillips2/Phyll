Central to Phyll's philosophy is simplicity without sacrifice. Register your device and add a plant to get started with watering alerts and vital soil quality data. Just having a look? No problem, Phyll's trove of horticultural best practices is available for all visitors, with or without our equipment, and our public social dashboard is always there to show the world where your green thumb ranks against other members of the community.
